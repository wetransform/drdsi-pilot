  <p>In the analysis phase of the project, we have received seven data sets from Moldova and five data sets from the Ukraine. For all data sets, we performed a quick quality analysis. This analysis included the following checks:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Completeness: Are all fields in the source data filled?</li>
    <li>Consistency: Are there many inconsistent values, such as overlapping geometries, or different spellings of the same names?</li>
    <li>Coverage: Can we likely get the minimum required information to fulfill INSPIRE requirements from the source data sets?</li>
    <li>Encoding: Is the encoding clear and correct?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This is an overview of all data sets we have analysed, and those we selected for the pilot project:</p>

  <p>This table summarizes the individual results per data set. We have used the validation (Schema + TEAM Engine, if appropriate), attribute coverage and analysis tools of <a href="https://www.haleconnect.com/">hale connect</a> to determine these values.</p>

  <p>This is part of an example analysis result, showing the attribute coverage of a given data set. We can quickly see whether any attributes are incomplete, and we can see if there are inconsistencies.</p>
