# Danube Reference Data Service Infrastructure - Data Harmonisation Pilot 

In this project, we have implemented a data mapping and transformation pilot in the context of the Danube Reference Data and Services Infrastructure (DRDSI) project, which supports the European Union Strategy for the Danube Region (EUSDR). The pilot involves all steps of a data harmonization project, from source data analysis over transformation to data publishing.

Through this work, we will create harmonized data that will add content and value to the existing DRDSI. The work aims at filling in gaps in regional datasets by creating harmonised data for bordering countries and documenting results for use in the DRDSI platform.

In this repository, you can find all the deliverables of the project, such as the hale studio alignmeent projects, links to services, and documentation.
