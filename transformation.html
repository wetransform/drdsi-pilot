    <p>Following the conceptual mapping, we proceeded to generate one harmonized, INSPIRE compliant data set for each of the mapping projects. We validated the generated files and used them as the basis to create download services.</p>

    <div style="margin: 20px">
        <img src="/images/transformation.png" title="Example analysis result for a data set" style="width: 100%; min-width: 400px;">
    </div>

    <p>No major problems were encountered during transformation and validation, though there were some issues e.g. with polygon winding order when transforming data from shapefiles. These have been resolved with the newest hale studio version (3.0.0+).</p>

    <h2>Resulting GML files</h2>
    <p>Use QGIS with the WFS 2.0 plugin1 or hale studio 3.0.02 to open and view these files. Alternatively, load them in degree to provide a Direct Access Download Services, as described in Deliverable D4.</p>
